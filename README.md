# Multiple-Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
Here we have created multiple linear regression model from scratch and when we compare it with original Linear regression model of sklearn it give us the same result.

First we have all necessary Library 
In this we are working with Diabetes data sets provide by sklearn
Then we have split our datasets in to train and test part
Then we have First import the model from sklearn library and run our dataset on that
Then we code our own Model in python.
And when we compare the results of both the model we got the same answers.
